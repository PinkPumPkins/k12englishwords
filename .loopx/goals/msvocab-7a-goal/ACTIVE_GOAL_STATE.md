# Active Goal State

## Objective

> 继续查找中学英语词汇，其中七年级上册是人教版ISBN号978-7-107-38254-3

## Authority Sources

- No explicit goal document was provided during bootstrap.

## Operating Contract

- Treat this file as the durable goal state for future agent ticks.
- Treat the authority sources above as the first context to inspect before acting.
- Read current project evidence before choosing the next action.
- Run a bounded progress segment when useful; it does not have to be one tiny step.
- Keep private evidence, credentials, local paths, and raw logs out of public commits.
- End each tick with changed files, validation, residual risk, and the next action.

## Execution Profile

- `cadence=bounded_progress_segment minimum=multi_surface_or_implementation include=coherent_artifact,targeted_validation,state_writeback spend_rule=spend_only_after_artifact_validation_writeback small_streak_threshold=2`
- Repeated small-scale follow-through should expand the next delivery batch or report a blocker before spending quota.

## Non-Goals

- Do not perform irreversible production operations without explicit approval.
- Do not publish private project evidence.
- Do not optimize for activity if no useful artifact or decision can be produced.
